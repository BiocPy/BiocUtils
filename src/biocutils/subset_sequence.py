    Subset ``x`` by ``indices`` to obtain a new object with the desired
    subset of elements. This attempts to use ``x``'s ``__getitem__`` method.

        x:
            Any object that supports ``__getitem__`` with an integer sequence.

        indices:
            Sequence of non-negative integers specifying the integers of interest.

        The result of slicing ``x`` by ``indices``. The exact type
        depends on what ``x``'s ``__getitem__`` method returns.
